# 🎉 Setup Complete!

Your local server is now running and accessible via the internet.

## ✅ Access Your App

Your app is live at both addresses:
- **[https://tranthachnguyen.com](https://tranthachnguyen.com)**
- **[https://www.tranthachnguyen.com](https://www.tranthachnguyen.com)**

## 🚀 How to Run Your Server

I've created a script to make this easy.

**To start the server:**
```bash
./start-server.sh
```
*This starts both your app and the secure tunnel.*

**To stop the server:**
Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal window.

## 🔒 Security

- Your connection is secured with HTTPS automatically.
- No ports are opened on your router.
- Your Mac must be **on and awake** for the site to work.
